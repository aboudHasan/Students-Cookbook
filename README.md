Student's Cookbook

Simply enter in your available ingredients, and once you've finished, hit find recipes. You will see a display of recipes, sorted by how many missing ingredients you have to complete the recipe.
Ideal for students who do not have access to many ingredients and don't know what to make for dinner besides plain chicken and rice.

Status: Usable, but still needs work.
